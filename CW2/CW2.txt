Writeup for second ABM coursework

SS1 default parameters:
Pop = 400
starting sugar random-in-range 5 25
metabolism random-in-range 1 4
vision random-in-range 1 6

SS2
default parameters for turtles are the same


Initial Observations

average vision increases initially as low vision turtles die off
average metabolism decreases gradually to start
Population reaches a steady state
This state state increases in proportion to the intial number of turtles because
	 a higher initial population raises the probability of turtles finding highly productive patches.




Reporters necessary
		  average suger for each turtle
		  average metabolism for each turtle
		  average metabolism to patch sugar ratio
		  average vision
